## Work Log:

**7-11-21:** I committed and pushed the react + tailwind css and a initial node express api template to github.<br/>
**8-11-21:** Tried to work with firebase and node, failed successfully, so went to work on frontend, Completed a little bit of the UI. I have a somewhat working UI, but I need to work on the backend.I should learn the firebase v 9.0 the imports are causing a lot of confusion for me, will try to watch a video or try to sit and read the official documentation, I also designed the database schema for couple components of the app.
